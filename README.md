## Hi there 👋

- ~I’m currently working on [my gorgeous MVP app](https://www.github.com/sthewissen/mvp)~ Unfortunately this one got killed by Microsoft 😅
- I occasionally blog about things I enjoy doing: https://thewissen.io
- I get schooled by my good friend Mark on a podcast regularly: https://nullpointers.io
- Ask me about .NET MAUI and/or mobile graphical thingamajigs.
- Reach me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/devnl) (yes, I'm calling it that).
- Pronouns: He/him.
- Fun fact: I love chocolate.

### I'm available for freelance work! 🧑‍💻
I'm a .NET developer from the Netherlands, specializing in mobile and web/backend development, though I'm always open to taking on new challenges. I love sharing knowledge with the community and find motivation in helping others through the content I create. I’m also passionate about design and enjoy incorporating creativity into my work. With a growth mindset, I'm constantly looking to learn and expand my skills. Outside of coding, you'll find me on Twitter, playing football, cycling, spending time with family, or enjoying a drink with friends. Bring cookies, chocolate, or a good sour beer, and we’ll get along great!
