## Hi there 👋

- ~I’m currently working on [my gorgeous MVP app](https://www.github.com/sthewissen/mvp)~ Unfortunately this one got killed by Microsoft 😅
- I occasionally blog about things I enjoy doing: https://thewissen.io
- I get schooled by my good friend Mark on a podcast regularly: https://nullpointers.io
- Ask me about .NET MAUI and/or mobile graphical thingamajigs.
- Reach me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/devnl) (yes, I'm calling it that).
- Pronouns: He/him.
- Fun fact: I love chocolate.

### I'm available for freelance work! 🧑‍💻
I’m a .NET developer from the Netherlands focusing on mobile and web/backend development. However, I will not shy away from new challenges. Sharing with the community and helping people with the content I create is what motivates me daily. I also have a passion for design, which I like to express in my work. I’m always eager to learn new things and consider myself to have a growth mindset. When I’m not coding you can find me on Twitter, playing football, cycling, being with my family, or just having the occasional drink with my friends. If you bring cookies, chocolate, and/or a nice beer we can quickly become best friends!
